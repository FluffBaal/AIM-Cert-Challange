**1-sentence problem statement**

Independent freelancers routinely leave money on the table because they can’t tell—mid-email—how well their price-negotiation language is landing or which objections they still need to neutralize.

**Why this matters for our user (the freelancer negotiating rates)**

For a solo freelancer, every project fee directly affects personal income and long-term business viability. Yet the final “price talk” happens in a medium (email or chat) where tone is hard to gauge, buyer objections are often unspoken, and response time is limited. Without a seasoned agent reading between the lines, freelancers default to guesswork: they under-quote to avoid scaring the prospect off, over-explain and sound defensive, or miss critical emotional cues—all of which erode perceived value and set a low ceiling for future gigs.

The cost isn’t just a smaller paycheck; anchoring low can peg the freelancer as “budget talent,” attract clients who haggle hard, and trigger a cascading effect on reputation and confidence. Automating a master-level negotiation coach—powered by techniques from *Never Split the Difference*—gives the freelancer real-time insights, recommended phrasing, and strategic counters so they can defend their worth, handle objections with empathy, and close deals at rates that truly reflect their expertise.

* “The client says my rate is above their budget—what’s the best reply?”
* “Which part of my email sounds weak or invites pushback?”
* “How can I anchor the conversation around value instead of hours?”
