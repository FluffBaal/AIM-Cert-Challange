# Task 6: My Retrieval Technique Experiments

## Quick Summary
So I tested 8 different retrieval techniques to see which one actually works best. Spoiler alert: the fancy Parent-Child approach I was excited about totally flopped, while the boring old Ensemble method crushed it. Here's what went down...

## The Contenders

### 1. BM25 (The Old-School Keyword Matcher)
**Score**: 0.787 retrieval (3rd place)

This is like the Ctrl+F of retrieval methods. Super simple, been around forever, but you know what? It works pretty darn well! 

**What I found**: It's amazing at finding exact matches. Search for "tactical empathy" or "FBI negotiator"? BM25's got you covered. No fancy AI needed - just good old term frequency math.

### 2. Dense Vector Retrieval (The Basic Embedding Approach)
**Score**: 0.743 retrieval

Used OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model for this one. It's like the vanilla ice cream of semantic search.

**The verdict**: It's okay. Finds related stuff even if the exact words don't match, but honestly? BM25 beat it, which was kinda embarrassing for all the fancy vector math involved.

### 3. Contextual Compression with Cohere (The Smart Filter)
**Score**: 0.797 retrieval, 0.935 generation (2nd place)

This one's clever - first retrieves a bunch of stuff, then uses Cohere to rerank and filter out the junk.

**Why it rocks**: Two-stage pipeline means you get quantity first, then quality. The reranking really helps cut through the noise. Plus, those generation scores? *Chef's kiss*

### 4. Multi-Query Retrieval (The Overthinker)
**Score**: 0.738 retrieval

Had GPT-4 generate multiple versions of each query to cast a wider net. Averaged 12.4 documents vs 10 for others.

**The catch**: It's slow. Like, really slow. Each query needs an LLM call first, so you're basically doubling your API costs and latency. The performance gain wasn't worth the wait.

### 5. Parent Document Retrieval (The Context Maximizer)
**Score**: 0.772 retrieval, 0.951 generation

Searches on small 500-char chunks but returns big 2000-char parent documents. Only returned 4.8 docs on average but they were GOOD ones.

**Key insight**: Sometimes less is more. Fewer, higher-quality results beat a pile of mediocre ones.

### 6. Ensemble Retrieval (The Winner!)
**Score**: 0.798 retrieval, 0.958 generation (1st place)

Combined BM25 and dense retrieval with equal weights using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Retrieved 17.2 documents on average.

**Why it won**: Best of both worlds! BM25 catches the exact matches, dense retrieval finds the semantic stuff, and RRF merges them beautifully. Simple, effective, no fancy tricks needed.

### 7. Semantic Chunking (The Smart Splitter)
**Score**: 0.775 retrieval

Used LangChain's SemanticChunker to split documents at natural boundaries instead of fixed sizes.

**The good**: Great recall (0.903) - finds most of what you're looking for
**The bad**: Had to limit to 20 docs because it kept hanging with more. Probably some optimization issues.

### 8. Parent-Child Advanced (The Disappointing Favorite)
**Score**: 0.435 retrieval, 0.862 generation (dead last)

My fancy hierarchical approach with 600-token parents and 100-140 token children, plus the "context corridor" feature I was so proud of.

**What went wrong**: Total architecture fail. Here's the deal:
- Embedded small child chunks (100-140 tokens) for search
- But returned entire parent chunks (600+ tokens) as results
- Kids don't have the important keywords that parents do
- RAGAS hated it because parents were full of irrelevant stuff

**The nail in the coffin**: 0.800 faithfulness score. The LLM just made stuff up because the retrieved context was garbage.

## Key Takeaways

### Winners
1. **Ensemble** - Just combine stuff that works. Don't overthink it.
2. **Cohere Reranking** - Quality filtering is worth the extra step
3. **BM25** - Never underestimate the classics

### Losers
1. **Parent-Child Advanced** - Cool idea, terrible execution
2. **Multi-Query** - Too slow for marginal gains
3. **Basic Dense Retrieval** - Needs help to compete

### Lessons Learned

**The Big One**: You can't search on tiny chunks and return huge chunks. Pick a lane!

**Also Important**: 
- Sometimes simple > complex
- Combining approaches > perfecting one approach  
- Test with your actual evaluation metrics (learned this the hard way)
- Context is great for generation but terrible for precision retrieval

## What Would I Do Differently?

If I could redesign the Parent-Child approach:
1. Return the child chunks, not the parents
2. Include parent metadata for context
3. Or just... use Ensemble because it already works great

## Final Thoughts

Started this thinking I'd revolutionize retrieval with my fancy Parent-Child architecture. Ended up learning that a simple combination of 20-year-old BM25 and basic embeddings beats everything else. 

Sometimes the best solution isn't the most sophisticated one - it's the one that actually works. And hey, at least I learned that the hard way so you don't have to!

## Wait... But What About Large Context Windows?

Here's something that's been bugging me though. We're living in the era of 128k, 200k, even 1M token context windows. Claude, GPT, and Gemini can handle massive amounts of context now. So why are we still optimizing for tiny, precise chunks?

### The Real Question

**Is RAGAS actually testing the wrong thing?**

Think about it:
- RAGAS penalizes you for retrieving "irrelevant" content
- But modern LLMs are REALLY good at finding the needle in the haystack
- Maybe retrieving larger context is actually BETTER for real-world performance?

### My Theory

The Parent-Child approach might have been ahead of its time. Here's why:

1. **LLMs are context monsters now** - They can handle and filter through massive amounts of text efficiently
2. **More context = better answers** - Even if 80% is "irrelevant", the LLM can use it for nuance and understanding
3. **RAGAS is stuck in 2022** - It's measuring precision like we're still working with 4k token limits

### What We Should Be Testing Instead

Maybe we need new metrics that consider:
- How well does the system perform with large-context LLMs?
- Does additional "irrelevant" context actually improve answer quality?
- What's the sweet spot between context size and LLM performance?

### The Irony

My "failed" Parent-Child approach that returns 2,500 character chunks might actually be perfect for modern LLMs. It's just that RAGAS is measuring it like it's 2022 and we're all still using GPT-3.5 with 4k tokens.

**Bottom line**: Maybe the problem isn't with large context retrieval. Maybe the problem is with how we're measuring success.
